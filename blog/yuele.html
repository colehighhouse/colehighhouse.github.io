    <div class="title">Yeule: Managing Our Virtual Lives</div>
   <p>I'm just about done with the first half of my final year of school. It's almost winter. Ohio's beginning to freeze over. Everything is moving slower.

    Yeule is a Singaporean artist making dream-pop for the next generation. Actively releasing music for over five years on Soundcloud, her next project titled “Seratonin II” is set to release sometime in the near future following a string of recent singles.
    
    The genius in yeule's production lies in the textures she creates commanding every inch of space placed overtop dancefloor-ready rhythms. On her latest single “Pretty Bones” her vocals float alongside the synths with almost ASMR like qualities. Singing poetically she recites “tired from the weight of it, wake up and you don't feel home,” later saying “then you think you own the world, but you can't control your fit.”
    
    Yeule in the past has worked alongside the LA label Zoom Lens, which was created under the idea of “the implications of popular culture on the human condition and the duality of musical creations discovered across the digital landscape.”
    
    So much of today's underground music deals with the idea of virtual and physical. I grew up with a computer on me at all times and have always been fascinated with the way people manage their online lives and how it compares to their real life personas. We've gotten to the point where social media is no longer a tool but an extension of ourselves whether we want it to be or not, and I don't necessarily see that as a bad thing.
    
    Using yeule as a prime example we see so many modern artists using social media as a way to further reinforce their art and build an image they may want to be associated with their work.
    
    If you're in your early 20's, like myself, you've had all of the information in the world at your fingertips for the majority of your life. We've been connected via social media since our early teens and for the most part we hardly remember a life before that. We are so connected with our digital personas and crafting them in a way that we want to be perceived, and I think the danger lies in people becoming too comfortable. We get the same likes and the same comments from the same followers. We like posts hoping they'll notice and return the favor. We accept all this praise as if it's not coming from a desire for reciprocation. Constantly built up in our own virtual worlds and communities from small towns that we feel this level of importance, like we “own the world.”
    
    Obsessed with this thing that is so much a part of us, we step outside and feel incomplete. We've so carefully crafted how we want to be perceived online and suddenly have to start over, or hope that they dig through our social media archive.
    
    How you handle the connection between your virtual and physical lives will always be under your control. Today many artists use this to their advantage and it can create beautiful interactions within communities. It's important not to fear these changes to the way we interact, but rather fight the urge to become comfortable.</p>
