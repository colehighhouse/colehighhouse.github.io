    <span class="header">LOS ANGELES</span>
    <br><br><br>
    March 17, 2020 I was living in Los Angeles, California. I finally had what I had been dreaming about for years. I was working an internship at a publicity company with some of the biggest artists in the world. I worked shows at The Forum, I saw artists at The Roxy, Wiltern, and Echo.  I had (potential) leads for places to work when that came to an end. I was (barely) affording rent and living the independent life outside of the midwest that I was waiting for.

    <br><br><br>
    Coronavirus news came fast, and I’m sure like for everyone else, the month was a blur. People stopped responding to emails, we started working from home, and the streets in Los Angeles were more quiet than usual. 
    <br><br>
    March 20, 2020 I began trying to sublease my apartment and move home to Ohio. I said goodbye to the couple of friends I had, quickly packed my life back into my 2012 Honda Civic, argued with my landlord, and made the 33 hour drive home by the end of the month. I’m not sure the exact feelings I had at the time but I know there was more relief than sadness. The first night of the drive I stayed at an Airbnb outside of Albuquerque. I’ll never forget arriving there and standing in his driveway late at night chatting about the news and football. There was a comfort in being outside of LA, knowing I won’t have to come up with $1,500 for rent next month, and a surrealness to everything happening in the world.

    After settling back in at home the confusion and irritation started. Over the next three months I downloaded dozens of online courses, interviewed for a coding school, watched the Trump press conferences everyday, and even started playing League of Legends again. Living in the US at this time felt like a fever dream.
    <br><br>
    Since I had left LA I stopped caring about music. I listened to podcasts more, didn’t pay attention to new releases, and would play three records on repeat when I needed background noise.

    I was jaded after feeling like I peaked in my interest for music discovery and it still wasn’t enough. I started getting angry at the process, feeling like it was all manufactured and passion didn’t play a role. I felt like I deserved to be a part of it more than others. I thought about how much connections played a role, and how small the industry felt. How much the cards are stacked against certain people and everything will always come down to nepotism. I became a sort of music-industry-incel.
    <br><br>
    For the first time in my life music just became something in the background, and I had no desire for it to be more. In a sense it was freeing, and the anger helped me to cope with my own failure and inability to do more with the opportunities I had. It shrouded from me the truth that I had fucked up and needed to reevaluate my approach.

    Eventually the unemployment checks stopped, the social pressures returned, and the future was less uncertain. Grad school seemed like the best option to delay the process of job searching a bit longer.

    My priorities shifted, and for the first time I was going to school without music being the focus. I thought that maybe I’d still like to work in entertainment, but this time it was about people. Music was secondary and I found myself listening to more. Moving through 2021 the anger I had previously towards the industry subsided. I understood the need for tastemakers, certain levels of nepotism, and the fact that my impact doesn’t need to be significant to be able to feel fulfilled.

    That summer these feelings peaked. The pressure was gone because I was pursuing something, school was relatively easy, and I had fully accepted the past year of changes.

    I knew it would come to an end. I’d finish school and have to figure something out. It began feeling cyclical. I knew I wanted to travel more, but I learned in LA how fast a healthy bank account can turn into paycheck to paycheck. I would think constantly about a job that I would actually feel happy doing everyday, but nothing ever came to mind. More and more COVID restrictions were lifted in the US and by the end of the year life was pretty much back to normal. There was no longer an excuse to delay things. School got more difficult. I knew I wanted to hurry up and graduate without knowing what I wanted after.

    By 2022 everyday was constant stress and attempts to fight it off. Music again fell out of my life. Why should I give it so much thought when it got me nowhere last time? Will I not just fall into the same hole if I try again to make it a part of my life? The feelings of being frustrated with LA turned into me feeling like I failed. I was only angry because I couldn’t do it and others could.
    <br><br>
    I was told about an opportunity to go to Shanghai for work. Initially feelings were shock, fear, excitement, and confusion. The months passed and I watched the pandemic situation in the city get worse. I hesitated but convinced myself adventure is what I need. I’m uncertain about the situation there but I genuinely see no path towards being satisfied in the states. 
    <br><br>
    I committed to pursuing the job. Now, even with a plan, the stress was heavier than before. It felt like at any moment things could fall apart. I went to therapy that summer for the first time in my life, and if I hadn’t I’m not sure I’d have gone through with moving. I talked a lot about how I felt I’d fallen out of love with music and the way that made me feel lost. I was so desperate for purpose and figuring out what comes next. Nothing would make me happy because I could only think about what I’ll need to eventually figure out.

    <span class="header">SHANGHAI</span>
    <br><br><br>
    After selling my car and giving away most of my clothes I packed what was left into one suitcase and a carry-on. October 10, 2022 I got on a plane to Hong Kong. All of the memories from my time studying abroad in 2018 came back. I thought again about how much I loved music at that time and how every performance or DJ I saw in the city would make me feel. I wanted so bad to figure out how to feel that again.

    I spent my days in quarantine playing these two records on repeat. I’d look out the balcony to nothing but fields and some mountains in the distance wondering if I made the right decision by coming here. The unsettled feeling didn’t go away until a few weeks after being in Shanghai. The more I continued meeting new people the more confident I felt in moving here. I was still hesitant about every experience, wondering what I should be doing. I went to a couple different shows and had fun but remained in my head about where I fit in and if I’m doing everything right. Eventually one night walking back home I had a strange feeling of relief that I hadn’t felt in a long time. I was living without thinking of what comes next. 
    <br><br>
    It felt freeing to no longer feel like I had to prove something to myself. I spent so long dealing with what success means to me and struggled so hard to enjoy what I had. 
    <br><br>
    I’ve gotten back the feeling of wanting to discover music. I get excited about the size of the country and the people I can meet. Not to prove anything to myself but just to gain perspectives. I still get frustrated sometimes when things seem unfair. Maybe it’s some shitty wannabe-European-techno-DJ at a bar with a bunch of people standing around just wanting to be seen. But I try to snap myself out of it. You’ll never please everyone and you’ll never change everyone’s mind. 
    <br><br>
    I want to find the music and artists that make me feel the way I did when I heard the A.G. Cook Radio Tank mix in 2013. Or maybe when I watched A.G. Cook on the PC Music Dead or Alive Halloween stream in 2014. Or the first time I heard the A.G. Cook remix of “Repeat Pleasures.”
