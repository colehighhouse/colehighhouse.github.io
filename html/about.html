        ACADEMIC WORK:
        I am currently an instructor at Shanghai International Studies University
        in the School of Journalism and Communication. I graduated from Bowling Green
        State University in 2019 (Bachelor's in the Entertainment Industry) and again 
        in 2022 (Master's in International Communication).
        <br>
        I have done research in areas including, but not limited to, China, TikTok, 
        new media, social media (general), live streaming, and the music industry. 
        I currently have <a href="https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/omgc-2022-0057/html" target="_blank">one publication</a> in Online Media and Global Communication. 
        <br>
        MUSIC:<br> 
        I have experience working in music publicity (internship with Biz 3) and 
        live event production (Premier Festival Staffing, CID Entertainment, 
        Insomniac Events). I am interested in forward-thinking music across all 
        genres and constantly seek artists that work to push boundaries in their 
        corner of the industry. I am passionate about the live music experience and 
        providing inclusive and unpretentious environments.
